            <h2>Pancit Bihon</h2>
            <p>Pancit Bihon is the most common type of pancit
                which is made with bihon noodles (rice vermicelli),
                a thin rice noodle. It is commonly made with chicken
                or pork, as well as a mix of vegetables, such as cabbage,
                carrots, and green beans.

            <h2>Pancit Malabon</h2>
            <p>Pancit Malabon originates from Malabon, Manila.
                This version of pancit shines the spotlight on
                seafood as you have the option to add shrimp,
                squid, or mussels. The sauce of this pancit 
                is another factor that makes it unique from the
                others.
